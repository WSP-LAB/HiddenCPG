Welcome to joern's documentation!
=================================

Joern is a platform for robust analysis of C/C++ code developed by
`Fabian Yamaguchi <https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/sec/team/fabs>`_ and
`Alwin Maier <https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/sec/team/alwin>`_ at the
`Institute of Systems Security <https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/sec>`_
of the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig. It is part of the octopus
project for graph-based program analysis tools. Joern generates *code
property graphs*, a novel graph representation that exposes the code's
syntax, control-flow, data-flow and type information in a joint data
structure. Code property graphs are stored in an OrientDB graph
database. This allows code to be mined using search queries formulated
in the graph traversal language Gremlin. In addition, long-running
analysis tasks can be implemented as plugins for the platform.

- **Fuzzy Parsing.** Joern employs a fuzzy parser. This allows code to
  be imported even if a working build environment cannot be supplied.

- **Code Property Graphs.** Joern creates code property graphs from
  the fuzzy parser output and makes and stores them in a Neo4J graph
  database. For background information on code property graphs, we
  strongly encourage you to read `our paper on the topic
  <http://user.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/~fyamagu/pdfs/2014-oakland.pdf>`_.

- **Extensible Query Language.** Based on the graph traversal language
  Gremlin, Joern offers an extensible query language based on
  user-defined Gremlin steps that encode common traversals in the code
  property graph. These can be combined to create search queries easily.

This is joern's official documentation. It covers its installation and
configuration, discusses how code can be imported and retrieved from
the database and gives an overview of the database contents.
