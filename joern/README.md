Source code analysis is full of graphs: abstract syntax trees, control
flow graphs, call graphs, program dependency graphs and directory
structures, to name a few. Joern analyzes a code base using a robust
parser for C/C++ and represents the entire code base by one large
property graph stored in a Neo4J graph database. This allows code to
be mined using complex queries formulated in the graph traversal
languages Gremlin and Cypher.
